From top to bottom, if you don't consider hoist.

### Name Convention

1. JavaScript : **camelCasing** e.g. **camelCaseEverything**

### ES6 2015

let, const, String Interpolation.

### let or const

Think about whether you’ll need to reassign the variable later on. If you do need to reassign the variable use let, otherwise, use const

### String Interpolation - template literals

```
const myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log(`I own a pet ${myPet}.`);
// Output: I own a pet armadillo.
```
Placeholder ${myPet} insert the value of myPet into the template literal. 

One of the biggest benefits to using template literals is the readability of the code. Using template literals, you can more easily tell what the new string will be. You also don’t have to worry about escaping double quotes or single quotes.

### operating order in js.

Depanding on diffrent operator, some of them are right to left, or left to right.

### Understanding how to read syntax on MDN

Every word in brackets means it is a option.
```
console.log(obj1 [, obj2, ..., objN]);
console.log(msg [, subst1, ..., substN]);
```

### Postfix and Prefix about Increment (++)

* If used postfix, with operator after operand (for example, x++), then it increments and returns the value before incrementing.
* If used prefix, with operator before operand (for example, ++x), then it increments and returns the value after incrementing.


```
// Postfix 
var x = 3;
y = x++; // y = 3, x = 4 return operand first, so the value of y is 3.

// Prefix
var a = 2;
b = ++a; // a = 3, b = 3 execute operator first, so value of b is 3.
```
