# Hi! My name is Nick!

Here are some projects and codes I wrote before, I learnt these things from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn), 
from the simplest to the advanced. Not only the syntax also including the principle about web develop. 
Such as request-respond circle and CURD, REST structure about API. 

I still learning the environment of Back-end but I've known how them work. My last goal is to become a front-end devloper 
but also understand the knowledge about back-end. 
If you are interested, you can send a mail to me, for I am looking for a job.

My personal web is [Hi! I'm Nick](https://ralaplines1988.github.io/) and my email address is at the bottom of the site.
Looking foraward to your mail! Thanks you!
