# Hi! My name is Nick!

Here are some projects and codes I wrote before, I learnt these things from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn), 
from the simplest to the advanced. Not only the syntax also including the principle about web develop. 
Such as request-respond circle and CURD, REST structure about API. 

I still learning the environment of Back-end but I've known how them work. My last goal is to become a full-stack developer. 
If you are interested, you can send a mail to me, for I am looking for a job.

My e-mail is ralap_lines1988@outlook.com
